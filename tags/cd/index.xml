Things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned: Nothing new.

However since I&amp;rsquo;m doing this challenge to motivate myself and to have constant progress in my project I will continue where I left off a few days ago.
Today&amp;rsquo;s Progress: Managed to get Jenkins collect all test results. Still don&amp;rsquo;t know why the integration tests are flickering.</description></item><item><title>[100 Days of Code] Day 059: June 11, 2017</title><link>https://roamingthings.de/posts/100doc-day059/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jun 2017 16:19:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://roamingthings.de/posts/100doc-day059/</guid><description>Today&amp;rsquo;s Progress: Wrote all Jenkins pipelines and wired the security-server project to the snapshot libraries on the public maven repo. Unfortunately when the build of security-server is running in Jenkins it&amp;rsquo;s failing also a local build succeeds.
Things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned: More about Jenkins pipelines.
Things I&amp;rsquo;ve planned for tomorrow: Investigate on the issue why the build fails on Jenkins and why test reports of integration tests don&amp;rsquo;t get collected by Jenkins.</description></item><item><title>[100 Days of Code] Day 055: June 6, 2017</title><link>https://roamingthings.de/posts/100doc-day055/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jun 2017 17:53:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://roamingthings.de/posts/100doc-day055/</guid><description>Today&amp;rsquo;s Progress: As I started to build my CD pipeline I noticed that I have some smaller &amp;ldquo;common&amp;rdquo; projects that have to be available in a repository in order to be used as a dependency during build. So I started to look into the different types of repositories that are available. Since my current project is publicly available I think that I also have to make the dependencies publicly available in a repository.</description></item><item><title>[100 Days of Code] Day 054: June 5, 2017</title><link>https://roamingthings.de/posts/100doc-day054/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jun 2017 17:38:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://roamingthings.de/posts/100doc-day054/</guid><description>Today&amp;rsquo;s Progress: Setup a Jenkins 2 server for CI/CD and created a simple pipeline.
Things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned: How to setup Jenkins 2 and how pipelines are working
Things I&amp;rsquo;ve planned for tomorrow: Improve pipeline
