Suddenly my integration tests that where using JPA did stop working. Finally I decided to switch to Hibernate which solved my problems.
Things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned: I will be using Hibernate from now on whenever possible.
Things I&amp;rsquo;ve planned for tomorrow: Continue to publish the whole dependency chain so I can continue with my CD pipeline.
