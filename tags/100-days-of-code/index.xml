This is due to the fact that I have been working on getting I2C working on my STM32 and just didn&amp;rsquo;t get it. Today I started a last try and finally was able to talk to let my STM32 talk to my BME280 environment sensor. I will post my findings in a separate post.</description></item><item><title>[100 Days of Code] Day 064: June 20, 2017</title><link>https://roamingthings.de/posts/100doc-day064/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jun 2017 18:10:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://roamingthings.de/posts/100doc-day064/</guid><description>Today&amp;rsquo;s Progress: Setup the project on a new board and rewired everything. This allows me to move the project around more easily. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been looking into more I2C code.
Things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned: I&amp;rsquo;ve seen the interior of a breadboard :) Finally&amp;hellip;
Things I&amp;rsquo;ve planned for tomorrow: Continue on I2C code.

Unfortunately it&amp;rsquo;s not running yet. Although the examples are working well, using these for an own project is not that easy.
Things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned: How to configure I2C on an STM32. Specially when it comes to more modern STM32 like the L4 family some things are different compared to the more mature families like the F1 or F4.
Things I&amp;rsquo;ve planned for tomorrow: Continue with I2C code.</description></item><item><title>[100 Days of Code] Day 062: June 18, 2017</title><link>https://roamingthings.de/posts/100doc-day062/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jun 2017 15:33:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://roamingthings.de/posts/100doc-day062/</guid><description>After struggling with the security server integration tests the last days (or weeks?) and being sick for the last days I decided to continue on my second project wich aims at reading and processing environmental data with a STM32 MCU. Today I setup the circuit and got into the Digilent Analog Discovery 2.

However since I&amp;rsquo;m doing this challenge to motivate myself and to have constant progress in my project I will continue where I left off a few days ago.
Today&amp;rsquo;s Progress: Managed to get Jenkins collect all test results. Still don&amp;rsquo;t know why the integration tests are flickering.</description></item><item><title>[100 Days of Code] Day 059: June 11, 2017</title><link>https://roamingthings.de/posts/100doc-day059/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jun 2017 16:19:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://roamingthings.de/posts/100doc-day059/</guid><description>Today&amp;rsquo;s Progress: Wrote all Jenkins pipelines and wired the security-server project to the snapshot libraries on the public maven repo. Unfortunately when the build of security-server is running in Jenkins it&amp;rsquo;s failing also a local build succeeds.
Things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned: More about Jenkins pipelines.
Things I&amp;rsquo;ve planned for tomorrow: Investigate on the issue why the build fails on Jenkins and why test reports of integration tests don&amp;rsquo;t get collected by Jenkins.</description></item><item><title>[100 Days of Code] Day 058: June 10, 2017</title><link>https://roamingthings.de/posts/100doc-day058/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jun 2017 17:54:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://roamingthings.de/posts/100doc-day058/</guid><description>Today&amp;rsquo;s Progress: I have not been able to work on the project as much as I&amp;rsquo;ve planned but have been able to publish the next artifact.

So I started to look into the different types of repositories that are available. Since my current project is publicly available I think that I also have to make the dependencies publicly available in a repository.</description></item><item><title>[100 Days of Code] Day 054: June 5, 2017</title><link>https://roamingthings.de/posts/100doc-day054/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jun 2017 17:38:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://roamingthings.de/posts/100doc-day054/</guid><description>Today&amp;rsquo;s Progress: Setup a Jenkins 2 server for CI/CD and created a simple pipeline.

Basically I&amp;rsquo;m trying to combine a REST resource secured by an OAuth 2 generated token (implicit grant type) and a &amp;ldquo;general&amp;rdquo; web page protected by a login form and session based authentication mechanism.
It seems as if all filters that are needed for the different authentication methods require a very special filter combination.</description></item><item><title>[100 Days of Code] Day 050: June 1, 2017</title><link>https://roamingthings.de/posts/100doc-day050/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2017 18:29:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://roamingthings.de/posts/100doc-day050/</guid><description>Today&amp;rsquo;s Progress: Another day struggling with OAuth 2 and Spring.

Also I know there are a lot of good ready-to-use servers and services out there I wanted to have a field to experiment with the thing that Spring offers.
I decided to start this project as an independent server which offers SSO authorization and user management for the other services and clients I plan to build.</description></item><item><title>[100 Days of Code] Day 045: May 26, 2017</title><link>https://roamingthings.de/posts/100doc-day045/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 May 2017 05:26:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://roamingthings.de/posts/100doc-day045/</guid><description>Today&amp;rsquo;s Progress: Did a lot of refactoring to introduce a modular architecture.

Unfortunately I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to get the example to compile (yet).
Things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned: I learned that I either do not know enough about the stm32-cmake toolchain I&amp;rsquo;ve been using so far or that it&amp;rsquo;s not easy to switch between HAL and LL drivers on a per project base.</description></item><item><title>[100 Days of Code] Day 032: May 10, 2017</title><link>https://roamingthings.de/posts/00doc-day032/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 May 2017 02:39:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://roamingthings.de/posts/00doc-day032/</guid><description>Today&amp;rsquo;s Progress: Finally setup the second &amp;ldquo;bigger&amp;rdquo; project I want to proceed. The aim is to learn about the STM32 by creating a small device based on a STM32 MCU that senses environmental information and finally transmits it over a (long range) wireless technology like LoRa or Zigbee.
Today I setup the basic project structure by copying an I2C project from the CubeMX framework into my project structure utilizing the stm32-cmake build chain I&amp;rsquo;ve updated in the last days.</description></item><item><title>[100 Days of Code] Day 031: May 9, 2017</title><link>https://roamingthings.de/posts/100doc-day031/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 May 2017 02:43:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://roamingthings.de/posts/100doc-day031/</guid><description>Today&amp;rsquo;s Progress: Migrated my stm32-blinky project to the stm32-cmake toolchain.

So far my experience is very mixed. There are days when I&amp;rsquo;ve lot of things to do and get back home very late. In this case it feels more like a burden to have the challenge going on. On other days it&amp;rsquo;s fine and I enjoy the focus I gain through the simple rules. Therefore the outcome of every day can vary a lot.</description></item><item><title>[100 Days of Code] Day 027: May 5, 2017</title><link>https://roamingthings.de/posts/100doc-day027/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 May 2017 19:59:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://roamingthings.de/posts/100doc-day027/</guid><description>Today&amp;rsquo;s Progress: Creating UserProfile after first login from GitHub or facebook.

Things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned: Following an example that was using the Thymeleaf mechanism I almost freaked out since I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get it to work in my project until I learned that and how I have to switch to Version 3 of Thymeleaf in my Spring Boot project.
Things I&amp;rsquo;ve planned for tomorrow: Utilize Thymeleaf to replace more static data with real values.</description></item><item><title>[100 Days of Code] Day 007: April 15, 2017</title><link>https://roamingthings.de/posts/100doc-day007/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Apr 2017 19:59:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://roamingthings.de/posts/100doc-day007/</guid><description>Today&amp;rsquo;s Progress: Moved to a new layout based on Bootstrap dashboard example and added a page example for editing.
Things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned: I&amp;rsquo;ve been used to write UIs using JSF.

Things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned: I came to the conclusion that a separate UI project will introduce a clean separation between UI and service. I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking if this is the right time to do this kind of split/refactoring or if it is better to continue implementing both parts in one project and do the refactoring later. However since I want to learn some best practices I decided to do the separation now.</description></item><item><title>[100 Days of Code] Day 005: April 13, 2017</title><link>https://roamingthings.de/posts/100doc-day005/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2017 08:36:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://roamingthings.de/posts/100doc-day005/</guid><description>Today&amp;rsquo;s Progress: Added infrastructure for UI using MVC and Thymeleaf.
Things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned: I&amp;rsquo;m used to implement views using JSF. I just learned that Thymeleaf behaves completely different.

I&amp;rsquo;m not embracing it completely on purpose (yet). Will do more comparision and experimentation when the project becomes more complex.
Things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned: It&amp;rsquo;s always gets hard when you start &amp;ldquo;fighting the system&amp;rdquo; by not using the tools provided but to force the framework into patterns you&amp;rsquo;ve learned with other frameworks.</description></item><item><title>[100 Days of Code] Day 002: April 10, 2017</title><link>https://roamingthings.de/posts/100doc-day002/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Apr 2017 19:59:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://roamingthings.de/posts/100doc-day002/</guid><description>Today&amp;rsquo;s Progress: Added a first entity (RecurringExpense) which is the core entity of the domain.
Things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned: I&amp;rsquo;ve started to big and wanted to put too much attributes and functionality into the first version. So I spend too much time thinking about details I might eventually need.
