In the series EMBEDDED WEDNESDAYS: GETTING STARTED IN EMBEDDED SYSTEMS you will find a very good introduction into developing embedded software using C on a STM32 MCU containing an ARM Cortex-M4F core.
The series starts by getting an introduction into the C programming language. Without getting too deep into the language you will learn enough to get started and implement your first projects that go well beyond the usual blinking LED (also this example is also included as an article).</description></item></channel></rss>
