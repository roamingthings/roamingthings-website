**Today's Progress**: Added a first entity (`RecurringExpense`) which is the core entity of the domain.

**Things I've learned**: I've started to big and wanted to put too much attributes and functionality into the first version. So I spend too much time thinking about details I might eventually need.  

**Link(s) to work**: [Expenses Service](https://github.com/roamingthings/expenses-service/commit/1852d341011a5485016cbf6498d6195c4646e7d8)
