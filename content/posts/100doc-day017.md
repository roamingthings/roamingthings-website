**Today's Progress**: Added field reference number and started investigation about useful integration tests for MVC controller. Also made test profile configurable and only loading sample data in dev profile.

**Things I've learned**: Handling active profile for testing and developing stage.

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Get more into testing of an MVC controller.
