Yesterday evening I have been at the [Nighthacking Germany Tour](https://blogs.oracle.com/java/entry/nighthacking_germany_tour) here in Berlin.

The presentations by [Sebastian Daschner](https://blog.sebastian-daschner.com) about _Putting Hypermedia Back in REST with JAX-RS_ and Stephen Chin about _Raspberry Pi with Java_ have been very inspiring.

First I learned about "real world" REST services that concentrate on resources and how to embed references to resources and actions to have better, client independent service interfaces.

In the second presentation Stephen Chin ([@steveonjava](https://twitter.com/steveonjava) showed us how he build a [Retro Game Console]() using a RaspberryPi, an Emulator written in Java and a case which he designed and created by himself.

Both presentations have been about very different topics and still have an interesting relation when it comes to real world objects.

You can watch a recording of the presentation on [http://nighthacking.com](http://nighthacking.com).
