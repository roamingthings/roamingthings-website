**Today's Progress**: **F-I-N-A-L-L-Y** got OAuth 2 and session/UI based authorization with Spring Security working.

**Things I've learned**: A lot about Spring Security filters, and security configuration.

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Improve the api of the server by adding some more features.

**Link(s) to work**: [security-server](https://github.com/roamingthings/security-server/commit/2904611d905ffac81b582173ec7fe93565d24134)
