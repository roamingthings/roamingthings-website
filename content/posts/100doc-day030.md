**Today's Progress**: Added basic support for STM32L4 family to the build system. Got a simple blinky test application working on a Nucleo-L476RG.

**Things I've learned**: The L4 family has two separate types of RAM which has to be factored in when generating the linker script.

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Either continue on the build-system or get back to the Spring application.

**Link(s) to work**: [stm32-cmake](https://github.com/roamingthings/stm32-cmake/commit/22541f826ad8809e386c182da3c744baac24342a)
