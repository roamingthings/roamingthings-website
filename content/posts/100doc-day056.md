**Today's Progress**: I have been fighting with eclipse link the whole time. Suddenly my integration tests that where using JPA did stop working. Finally I decided to switch to Hibernate which solved my problems.

**Things I've learned**: I will be using Hibernate from now on whenever possible.

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Continue to publish the whole dependency chain so I can continue with my CD pipeline.

**Link(s) to work**: [rules-jpa](https://github.com/roamingthings/rules-jpa/commit/063de2b97a9db868bf2fd135146b2b1aa7f95a47)
