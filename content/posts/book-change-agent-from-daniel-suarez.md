Today I finished the book 'Change Agent' written by Daniel Suarez. I've listened to the audiobook narrated by Jeff Gurner.

As usual with stories from this author it's a reasonable look into a possible future not far away packt into an action heavy story. This time the main topics are augmented reality (AR), self driving cars and most of all genetic engineering.

If you like novels about technology with a lot of action this (audio)book is definitely
for you.
