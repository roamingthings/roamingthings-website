**Today's Progress**: Added entity listeners to update meta information regarding create and modify.

**Things I've learned**: Test support provided by the Spring Framework speeds up development of tests.

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Since I didn't get to this task today: Add some more (complex) attributes and prepare a web ui.
