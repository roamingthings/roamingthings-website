**Today's Progress**: Implemented integration-tests for OAuth 2 token retrieval.

**Things I've learned**: Learned many details about the different OAuth 2 grant_types and flows. This demonstrates how much you can learn when implementing tests ;)

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Cleanup the tests and maybe implement some more API endpoints.
