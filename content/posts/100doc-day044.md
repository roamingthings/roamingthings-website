**Today's Progress**: Finished implementation of first OAuth server version. Also did some bigger refactoring and made tests work again.

**Things I've learned**: A lot about Spring Security / OAuth.

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Continue on OAuth. Write some tests to obtain and use token.
