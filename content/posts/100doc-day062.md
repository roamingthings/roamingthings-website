After struggling with the security server integration tests the last days (or weeks?) and being sick for the last days I decided to continue on my second project wich aims at reading and processing environmental data with a STM32 MCU. Today I setup the circuit and got into the [Digilent Analog Discovery 2](http://store.digilentinc.com/analog-discovery-2-100msps-usb-oscilloscope-logic-analyzer-and-variable-power-supply/).

**Today's Progress**: Setting up the circuit and testing an I2C display with an Arduino which I will use as a _Hello World_ tool.
No source to be shared but a picture of my crude setup ;)

**Things I've learned**: How to use the Digilent Discovery 2

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Start with an application to connect to the display with the Nucleo board that I will use.
