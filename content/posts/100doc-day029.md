**Today's Progress**: Removed OAuth2 authentication and implemented authentication based on Spring Security. User and Roles are stored in the database. Also implemented Test (kind of TDD)

**Things I've learned**: Basic mechanisms of Spring Security, improved on how to write tests using Mockito

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Start implementing a simple user management.
