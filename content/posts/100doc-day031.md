**Today's Progress**: Migrated my `stm32-blinky` project to the `stm32-cmake` toolchain.

**Things I've learned**: More understanding of CMake and the development process.

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Setting up a small project to access a BME 280 sensor.

**Link(s) to work**: [stm32-blinky](git@github.com:roamingthings/stm32-blinky476.git)
