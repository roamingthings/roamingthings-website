**Today's Progress**: Moved to a new layout based on Bootstrap dashboard example and added a page example for editing.

**Things I've learned**: I've been used to write UIs using JSF. The more I get into Thymleaf I notice that the paradigm and mechanisms are completely different and I need some more time to wrap my head around. However I like the approach to first model in "pure" HTML and later switch to a Thymleaf template

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Use Thymeleaf to reuse parts of the UI.
