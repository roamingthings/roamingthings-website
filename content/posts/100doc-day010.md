**Today's Progress**: Learned about projections when it comes to REST resources in Spring. List of expenses now contains "real" values.

**Things I've learned**: How to access the system id without parsing the link / resource that is included. I'm using a projection to add the entity id as a property `systemId` and use this in the list.

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Try to get the edit page working.

**Link(s) to work**: [Expenses Service](https://github.com/roamingthings/expenses-service/commit/4988fb7b4e3a0a0a1abdb7a7dfc3a7f96f1e4d31)
