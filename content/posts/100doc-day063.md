**Today's Progress**: Started to write I2C code. Unfortunately it's not running yet. Although the examples are working well, using these for an own project is not that easy.

**Things I've learned**: How to configure I2C on an STM32. Specially when it comes to more modern STM32 like the L4 family some things are different compared to the more mature families like the F1 or F4. 

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Continue with I2C code.

**Link(s) to work**: none for today
