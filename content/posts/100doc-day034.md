**Today's Progress**: Added a principal to the authentication log, implemented some integration tests and created a separate source tree for integration tests (thank you Gradle!)

**Things I've learned**: Separating integration tests with gradle. More on jdbc template.

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Catch all security relevant events to finally create log entries.
