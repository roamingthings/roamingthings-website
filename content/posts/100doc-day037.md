**Today's Progress**: Implemented a custom Spring `AuthenticationProvider` and supporting classes.

**Things I've learned**: More about the inner mechanics of Spring Security. How to retrieve, authenticate and check a request.

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Implement the mechanism to check the status of an account based on auditing data.
