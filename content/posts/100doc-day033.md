**Today's Progress**: I setup a new small Spring Boot application to test an idea that came in my mind to determine if the state of an account (e.g. if it's blocked due to false credentials) just based on logging authentication incidents. If it works well I will use it in my expense application.

**Things I've learned**: Setup a Sprint Boot application using Spring Security with a database.

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Use the weekend to continue work on the STM32 project.
