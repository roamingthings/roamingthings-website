**Today's Progress**: Wrote all Jenkins pipelines and wired the security-server project to the snapshot libraries on the public maven repo. Unfortunately when the build of `security-server` is running in Jenkins it's failing also a local build succeeds.

**Things I've learned**: More about Jenkins pipelines.

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Investigate on the issue why the build fails on Jenkins and why test reports of integration tests don't get collected by Jenkins.
