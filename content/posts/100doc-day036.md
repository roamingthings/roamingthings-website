**Today's Progress**: Added a UserDetailsService and did some refactoring.  
Also tried to progress on STM32 firmware development but had a hard time fighting against Eclipse and the CubeMX project structure. I will continue on that when I have more time.

**Things I've learned**: I read more about the Spring Security framework and implemented a basic `UserDetailsService` to practice what I've read. I will add more functionality as I continue the project.

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Start using the authentication log to finally decide whether an account is blocked. I plant to add this functionality to a custom `AuthenticationManager`.
