# Software Development, Agile and Mobile Technology â€” My passion and fascination.

My name is Alexander Sparkowsky. I'm a graduated Engineer (Dipl.-Ing.),  passionate and professional software engineer, tinkerer and maker based in Berlin, Germany.

My professional work focusses on enterprise Applications, Agile, DDD and embedded systems.

## Creating Software is a Craft

From my experience creating software is not just writing code but a craft following some core values:

- Value for the customer
- Sustainability
- Quality
- Readability
- Simplicity
- Self-documented

## How I like to work

When working communication and creativity are key to success. Therefore my preferred way to work is characterised by

- Room to be creative - I like sketching and drawing to to illustrated problems, find solutions and communicate with others
- No silos - Especially on complex systems it's very important that everybody shares their knowledge
- Communicate respectful and open
- Work in an agile environment - I don't care if it's called Scrum, Kanban or 'Scrumban'

## What interests me

I'm developing Software in Java since version 1.0.2 in the late 1990s. It is still one of my favourite platforms. Lately I started to embrace Kotlin as a pragmatic and modern alternative in the JVM space. 

Since my early youth I'm fascinated from working with microcontrollers. Back then I started to discover Z80, 8051 and AVR. In the early 2000s I developed systems utilizing Bluetooth and iBeacon technology.

Beside my interest in computing I love analog and digital photography.

You can also talk with me about brewing and enjoying a good cup of coffee.

## Professional Experience

Throughout my career I've developed software using Java, JavaEE and Spring Boot. I've also being developing mobile applications for iOS.

- Since 2017 I'm working as a Senior Software Engineer and team architect at DPDHL IT Services (Berlin) GmbH. Through this work I learned how to work with very large and complex systems in an agile environment.
- In 2018 I co-authored "Spring Boot 2 Fundamentals"  published on [Packt Publishing Ltd](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/spring-boot-2-fundamentals).
- Still being studying computer science I became a co-founder and managing director of LambdaLogic Informationssyteme GmbH in 1999. During the following 17 years I learned how to provide software and services for events reaching from small company events to  conferences up to 30,000 pax.
I learned how to manage a business, work with customers from acquiring to implement and later deliver a project, got insights of the event management sector and experienced software development.
- I've graduated in Computer Science (Technische Informatik) at the TU Berlin.
