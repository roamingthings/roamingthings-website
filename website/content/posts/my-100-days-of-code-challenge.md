One of my permanent aims is to improve my skills in professional software development and methodologies like Domain Driven Development (DDD), Test Driven Design and Continuous Delivery. In addition to that there are some projects I want to implement.

Until now I've ben struggling where to start and how to measure "improving". However this weekend I learned about the [100 Days of Code challenge](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4) on the [Codenewbies Podcast](http://www.codenewbie.org/blogs/100-days-of-code-codenewbie-edition). Alexander Kallaway saw himself in a similar situation.

So I decided to start my own [100 Days of Code challenge](https://github.com/roamingthings/100-days-of-code) by just starting.
