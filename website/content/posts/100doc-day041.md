**Today's Progress**: Unsuccessfully tried to configure IntelliJ via Gradle to include the Angular webinar generated by one subproject as a runtime artifact to the backend project. Eventually gave up. Will continue tomorrow.

**Things I've learned**: ---

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Continue to setup the IntelliJ project by gradle.

**Link(s) to work**: Unfortunately no visible progress today.
