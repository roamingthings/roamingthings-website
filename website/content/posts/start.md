I've tried to start blogging before. But like many other I didn't stick to it very long. This is another try to share my thoughts, ideas and things I discover.

### The problem

I came to the conclusion that I wanted to much to fast. Having a great design, thousands of great plugins, galleries for my photography...

I never really finished starting. There is this WordPress instance on a server waiting to be finished. Or my SquareSpace account with a lot of half finished content and still placeholder images I eventually wanted to replace with my own photography. I've canceled my account after paying for almost two years without ever publishing any article.

### Why is it worth to give it another try?

In my everyday life I profit a lot from things other people have encountered. This is true for my private and professional life. I want to contribute to this global community.

I like tinkering around and discover things. Hopefully this will help one or the other reaching a goal or feeling better. 

### What will be different this time

So what will I do different this time?

This time I decided not to go with a full blown WordPress installation at the beginning but starting with this simple [ghost.io](http://ghost.io) blog running on a VPS provided by [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/966cb2df6071). No Big theme, no plugins just simple content. 

I thought about using [tumblr](http://tumblr.com) or [Medium](http://medium.com) but I want to own my content and be able to mess around with it the way I want. However that doesn't mean that I will not try to post one thing or the other on these platforms since I do like and use them a lot.

### What can you expect

First of all: Nothing ;)

I hope I will find the time to write about many stuff I enjoy. Be it things I learn from being a professional software developer. Things I encounter when tinkering with the "Internet of Things". Or maybe you will find some photography I'm doing or learn about the gear I'm using.

However this time I will not promis anything. Neither to my readers and not to myself. You will not find polished texts but instead a lot of typing errors.

Let's find out...
