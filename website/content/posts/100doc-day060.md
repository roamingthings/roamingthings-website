Unfortunately I had some important things to manage in the last days and therefore have not been able to work a lot on my projects.
However since I'm doing this challenge to motivate myself and to have constant progress in my project I will continue where I left off a few days ago.

**Today's Progress**: Managed to get Jenkins collect all test results. Still don't know why the integration tests are flickering.

**Things I've learned**: How to write better Jenkins pipelines.

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Continue investigation on flickering tests. Theses tests start to annoy me. However I'm sure that as soon as I've identified the reason it will help improving the implementation.
