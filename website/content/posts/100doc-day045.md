**Today's Progress**: Did a lot of refactoring to introduce a modular architecture. I hope that this will help me to introduce and test features. Also it's some kind of a test for this architecture.

**Things I've learned**: More about context discovery in Spring (Boot) including some special cases in integration tests.

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Continue on OAuth by trying to connect a client.
