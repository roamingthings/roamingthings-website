**Today's Progress**: Edit existing entities in a HTML form with Thymeleaf.

**Things I've learned**: I learned about the basic round trip, how Thymeleaf and Spring handle and convert data passed back and forth.

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Strengthen the form, Add validation (messages), create new instances and look for/compare with "best practices". _Most of all add tests!_
