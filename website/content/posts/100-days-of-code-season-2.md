In the last year I already tried the [http://www.100daysofcode.com/](100 Days of Code) challenge but eventually gave up. I have been to busy due to my day job and the additional mental preassure let me finally gave up on [https://roamingthings.de/100doc-day065/](Day 65)
However I still like the idea and think that I can approach the challenge this time with a fresh and different perspective. This means that I may deviate from rule 1. You may say that then it's not a true _100 Days of code_ challenge but for me the main reason for doing this is constant working on projects, learning something new while still keeping a healthy life.
