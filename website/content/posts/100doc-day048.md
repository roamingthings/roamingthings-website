**Today's Progress**: Continued on getting a form based login in the authorization server to work. Obviously I didn't yet quiet understand the form based login mechanism in Spring. So I will concentrate on that tomorrow.

**Things I've learned**: Nothing final yet

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Invest more time in looking at the form based login mechanism in Spring Security.

**Link(s) to work**: No visible work for today
