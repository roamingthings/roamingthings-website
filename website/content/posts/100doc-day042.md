After being not able to work on the project in the last days on a regular basis due to personal reasons I'm now back on my regular schedule.

**Today's Progress**: Started migrating to OAuth 2 (again) and Liquibase because of some plans I have for the future direction I want to take with this project.

**Things I've learned**: Also I already did work with Liquibase I learned some more details about changelogs. I also looked deeper into OAuth 2 with Spring by looking at the [Spring Security OAuth](https://github.com/Baeldung/spring-security-oauth) examples from [Baeldung](baeldung.com)

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Continue on the migration to Liquibase and OAuth 2

**Link(s) to work**: The project is in an intermediate state and will not run. I don't like to commit unfinished work but since this is a side project I have to stop from time to time. [expenses-services](https://github.com/roamingthings/expenses-service)
