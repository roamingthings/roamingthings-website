**Today's Progress**: Figured out how to use the Thymeleaf layout mechanism. Added Font Awesome.

**Things I've learned**: Following an example that was using the Thymeleaf mechanism I almost freaked out since I couldn't get it to work in my project until I learned that and how I have to switch to Version 3 of Thymeleaf in my Spring Boot project.

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Utilize Thymeleaf to replace more static data with real values.
