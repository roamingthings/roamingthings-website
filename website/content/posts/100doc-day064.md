**Today's Progress**: Setup the project on a new board and rewired everything. This allows me to move the project around more easily. I've also been looking into more I2C code.

**Things I've learned**: I've seen the interior of a breadboard :) Finally...

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Continue on I2C code.

**Link(s) to work**:
