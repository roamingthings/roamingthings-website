**Today's Progress**: Implemented a MockMvc based integration test to test successful and unsuccessful login.

**Things I've learned**: How to test a Spring (Boot) application by using the `MockMvc` class. Also learned about a bug that I was able to fix thanks to the tests.

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Look into Angular as a client.
