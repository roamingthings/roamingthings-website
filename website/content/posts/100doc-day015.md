**Today's Progress**: Wrote first MVC integration tests. Started migration to `LocalDate`.

**Things I've learned**: Learned about testing ov Spring MVC controllers including mocking. Also learned about using `LocalDate` instead of `Date`.

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Create new entities. Write more MVC integration tests.
