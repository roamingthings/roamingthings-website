This weekend I have been tinkering around with Kotlin, Spring Boot and Angular 4.

I experienced how to combine everything in a multi-project using Gradle as a build tool.

As I'm getting more into Kotlin I like it more and more. Especially the lack of a lot of boilerplate code is very refreshing. I still have to improve on the overall style but I will definitely use Kotlin more in the future.

You can find the source of the still evolving experiment in my [GitHub](https://github.com/roamingthings/dev-workbench) account.
