**Today's Progress**: Learned about how to handle HATEOAS in the Spring Framework by getting a list of recurring expenses.

**Things I've learned**: HATEOAS is an interesting mechanism but hard to handle. The whole project starts to smell like Cargo Cult. I may start over with a much smaller / simpler approach.

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Try to extract the id from HATEOAS objects and decide to continue on this route or switch over to a monolith architecture (very likely).
