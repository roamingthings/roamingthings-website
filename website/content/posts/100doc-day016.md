**Today's Progress**: Added a lot of Docker stuff: Building an image,orchestration with docker swarm and load balancing. Also new entities can now be created.

**Things I've learned**: Learned about building a docker image with gradle, pushing to a registry and setting up a container infrastructure with load balancing.

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Improve database setup and initialization.
