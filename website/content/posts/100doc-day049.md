**Today's Progress**: Improved security configuration but still not where I want to be.

**Things I've learned**: Spring Security (again). I'm sure there is just one tiny pice missing.

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Continue working on the authentication.

**Link(s) to work**: [security-server](https://github.com/roamingthings/security-server/commit/3c509ee5eba23de9d822346f3fb52081fd202ea2)
