Security Server
---------------

While I've been tinkering around with Spring Security and all the nice things it offers I became very interested in this
domain. Also I know there are a lot of good ready-to-use servers and services out there I wanted to have a field to
experiment with the thing that Spring offers.

I decided to start this project as an independent server which offers SSO authorization and user management for the other services and clients I plan to build.

**Today's Progress**: Extracted the authentication server parts I've already written for the expenses-service into an own project.

**Things I've learned**: Nothing new.

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Add a module/service for user management.
