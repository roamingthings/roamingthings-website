**Today's Progress**: Still (unsuccesfully) trying to figure out how to create a local profile for a successful OAuth2 authentication.

**Things I've learned**: More Spring Security.

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Continue on `UserProfile` handling/creation.

**Link(s) to work**: [Expenses Service](https://github.com/roamingthings/expenses-service/commit/1f52f69e5782f99fe8289fcd30534714dc670069)
