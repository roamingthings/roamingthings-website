**Today's Progress**: Finally integrated the authentication logging with the authentication process. Now an account becomes locked when a consequent number of failed attempts to login has been recorded.

**Things I've learned**: How to integrate the additional checking into the Spring Security mechanism.

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Write tests to verify the functionality. I know that I should have done this first but I've been to impatient.
