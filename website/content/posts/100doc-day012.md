**Today's Progress**: Added form validation.

**Things I've learned**: I learned about the basic validation mechanism in Spring MVC.

**Things I've planned for tomorrow**: Strengthen the form, Add validation (messages), create new instances and look for/compare with "best practices". _Most of all add tests!_
