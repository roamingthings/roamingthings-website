Things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned: Learned many details about the different OAuth 2 grant_types and flows. This demonstrates how much you can learn when implementing tests ;)
Things I&amp;rsquo;ve planned for tomorrow: Cleanup the tests and maybe implement some more API endpoints.

Also I know there are a lot of good ready-to-use servers and services out there I wanted to have a field to experiment with the thing that Spring offers.
I decided to start this project as an independent server which offers SSO authorization and user management for the other services and clients I plan to build.</description></item></channel></rss>
